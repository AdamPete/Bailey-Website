      <p>While attending Purdue University I was approached by the School of Pharmacy to create an
        advertisement for their
        upcoming exhibit: The Brainflower, to accompany their #HopeStems mission.

        For this project I had full creative control to shoot and edit everything myself; including all
        cinematography,
        video
        effects, and audio.

        This spot won an Award of Excellence at the BEA 2020 Film Festival.</p>
