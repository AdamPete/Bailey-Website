      <p>While attending Purdue University I was approached by the School of Pharmacy to create an
        advertisement for their
        upcoming exhibit: The Brainflower, to accompany their #HopeStems mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this project I had full creative control to shoot and edit everything myself; including all
        cinematography,
        video
        effects, and audio.
